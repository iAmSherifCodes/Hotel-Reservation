# Hotel-Reservation
 
## Project Description

Designing and implementing a Python hotel reservation application. The hotel reservation application will allow customers to find and book a 
hotel room based on room availability.

### Project Requirement
**1** - Two people should not be able to book the same room on the same date.

**User Scenarios**

The application provides four user scenarios:

• Creating a customer account.

The user needs to first create a customer account 
before they can create a reservation. 

• Searching for rooms.

The app should allow the user to search for available 
rooms based on provided checkin and checkout dates. If the application has 
available rooms for the specified date range, a list of the corresponding rooms will 
be displayed to the user for choosing. 

• Booking a room.

Once the user has chosen a room, the app will allow them to 
book the room and create a reservation. 

• Viewing reservations.

After booking a room, the app allows customers to view a 
list of all their reservations.

**Admin Scenarios** 


The application provides four administrative scenarios:

• Displaying all customers accounts.

• Viewing all the rooms in the hotel.

• Viewing all the hotel reservations.

• Adding a room to the hotel application.

### Goal

To demonstrate ability to design classes using OOP, organise and process data with collections..
